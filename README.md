<h2 align="center">Hello there! My name is Lukas von Ehr. </h2>
<p align="center">I am a C#/Python Developer from Germany. <br>
I am working for a bioscience company and doing my B.Sc. in Data Science, and I also like being busy with my programming projects.
I am currently working with C# applications, also doing much testing with xUnit and learning many things about Data Science related topics. <br>
Apart from programming, I like to play video games, lift heavy things, play chess, drive my motorcycle, and many other things. </p>
