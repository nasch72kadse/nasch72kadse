<h2 align="center">Hello there! My name is Lukas von Ehr. </h2>
<p align="center">I am a Python/C# Developer from Germany. <br>
I am doing my B.Sc. in Data Science while working for a company that develops ERP applications, and I also like being busy with my programming projects.
I am currently working with technologies like FastReport, Machine Learning, REST, Odoo, C# client applications, and Routing & Switching. <br>
Apart from programming, I like to play videogames, lift heavy things, play chess, drive my motorcycle, and many other things.
